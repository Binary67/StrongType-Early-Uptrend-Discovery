# AGENTS.md — Contributor Guide

*(Place this file at the root of any folder where you want the agent to pick up these rules.)*

## 1  Project Layout

| Path           | Purpose                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **main.py**    | Single, authoritative entry‑point. Keep it up to date with every feature or refactor. |
| **UnitTests/** | Mirrors the source tree; holds unit tests for each module that has them.              |
| **Logs/**      | Rotating runtime logs (directory is Git‑ignored).                                     |

## 2  Naming & Style Conventions

* **PascalCase** for *every* new **file**, **variable**, **function**, and **class** name.

  * *Exception*: keep Python built‑ins and third‑party identifiers in their original casing.
* Follow PEP 8 for formatting; run `ruff check .` and `mypy .` before committing.

## 3  Development Workflow

1. **Implement** the feature/fix, adhering to the naming rules above.

2. **Add or update unit tests *only* for the modules/methods you created or affected in *this* development session.**

   * Place new tests in *UnitTests/*\*\*, mirroring the source‑tree structure of the code you touched.
   * Do **not** regenerate or re‑run tests for unrelated modules at this stage.

3. **Run the applicable tests** to verify your changes, for example:

   * `pytest UnitTests/path/to/test_new_feature.py` – or –
   * `pytest UnitTests/ -k "NewFeature"`
     All targeted tests **must pass**.

4. **Lint & type‑check**: `ruff` and `mypy` must pass.

5. **Update main.py** to wire up any new modules or dependencies.

6. **Run end‑to‑end**: `python main.py`; fix issues until it exits cleanly.

## 4  Logging

* Use the standard `logging` library with a rotating file handler that writes to *Logs/*.
* Avoid `print` in production paths.

---

## 5  Debugging & Troubleshooting

* On any error, **search the web** (docs, Stack Overflow, etc.) and document non‑obvious fixes in code comments.

---

## 6  Secrets Management

* Azure OpenAI credentials are provided via environment variables.
* **Never** hard‑code secrets or commit them to the repo.

---

## 7  Pull‑Request Checklist

* ✅ Targeted unit tests pass.
* ✅ `main.py` runs without error.
* ✅ No plaintext secrets or log files committed.

---

*Keep this guide concise; update sections rather than scattering new rules across the codebase.*
